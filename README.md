This folder contains the machine learning projects I am pursuing to refine my knowledge about this subject. 

So far the folder contains:

- a natural language processing project in which I am analyzing the texts of several customer reviews to extrapolate their sentiments;

- a random forest classifier project where the purpose is to predict the price trend of a stock based on various financial indicators;

- a K-Means clustering project in which customers are grouped together on the basis of common traits.
